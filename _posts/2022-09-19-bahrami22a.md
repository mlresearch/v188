title: 'BERT-Sort: A Zero-shot MLM Semantic Encoder on Ordinal Features for AutoML'
openreview: rE2g8Qf6req

abstract: 'Data pre-processing is one of the key steps in creating machine learning
  pipelines for tabular data. One of the common data pre-processing operations implemented
  in AutoML systems is to encode categorical features as numerical features. Typically,
  this is implemented using a simple alphabetical sort on the categorical values,
  using functions such as OrdinalEncoder, LabelEncoder in Scikit-Learn and H2O. However,
  often there exist semantic ordinal relationships among the categorical values, such
  as: quality level (i.e., [’very good’ \ensuremath{>} ’good’ \ensuremath{>} ’normal’\ensuremath{>}
  ’poor’]), or month (i.e., [’Jan’\ensuremath{<} ’Feb’ \ensuremath{<} ’Mar’]). Such
  semantic relationships are not exploited by previous AutoML approaches. In this
  paper, we introduce BERT-Sort, a novel approach to semantically encode ordinal categorical
  values via zero-shot Masked Language Models (MLM) and apply it to AutoML for tabular
  data. We created a new benchmark of 42 features from 10 public data sets for sorting
  categorical ordinal values for the first time, where BERT-Sort significantly improves
  semantic encoding of ordinal values in comparison to the existing approaches with
  27% improvement. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of BERT-Sort on different
  public MLMs, such as RoBERTa, XLM and DistilBERT. We also compare the performance
  of raw data sets against encoded data sets through BERT-Sort in different AutoML
  platforms including AutoGluon, FLAML, H2O, and MLJAR to evaluate the proposed approach
  in an end-to-end scenario, where BERT-Sort achieved a performance close to a hard
  encoded feature. The artifacts of BERT-Sort is available at https://github.com/marscod/BERT-Sort.'
